## Legal questions & answers

## Questions

> Since we used `two` **Machine Learning** models, we'll provide separate answers to each question.

1. Is there someone who can provide an explanation that is accessible to the wider public?
2. Is there someone within the team that can explain how the algorithm works?
3. Does the project make use of an algorithm or some form of machine learning or neural networks?

## Answers

1. Yes, the whole team who worked on this project.
2. Yes, the group who worked on the Machine Learning models.
    * The group who worked on the Machine Learning models:
        * Andrea - Machine Learning models
        * Borislav - Machine Learning models
        * Neil - Evaluation of the ML models
3. Yes, it does. It uses [**Random Forest
   Regression
   **](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/2022-23d-1fcmgt-reg-ai-01-group-team5/blob/main/src/model/RF_model.ipynb)
   and [**Linear Regression with Interaction

* Explanation of the model:  
  *The model works by training a random forest regression algorithm to predict the livability index of different
  neighborhoods. It analyzes the characteristics of each neighborhood, such as green spaces, registered incidents of
  nuisance, registered crimes, and migration patterns. The algorithm learns patterns and relationships between these
  features and the livability index through training on the available data. The model also provides insights into the
  importance of different features for predicting livability.*

### Borislav - [Linear Regression with Interaction Terms](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/2022-23d-1fcmgt-reg-ai-01-group-team5/blob/main/src/model/LR_model_with_interactions.ipynb)

* Explanation of the model: *Based on the Simple Linear Regression model which tries the relationship between a scalar
  response and one or more
  explanatory variables, an interaction terms allows the model to make the relationship between one variable X1 and Y
  dependent on another variable X2.*
